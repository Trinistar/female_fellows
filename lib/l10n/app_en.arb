    "homeTandemstoryOneBodyTwo": "It was an opportunity for both of us to get to know each other: I wasn't the only one who taught Makai German and something about life here - I was also able to learn a lot from her and her family about Afghanistan, the way of life there and also about the conditions for refugees here in Germany. I think it's really important as a woman to encourage other women to take advantage of all the opportunities we have. We also did lots of leisure activities together in Stuttgart, went swimming, to the park or the library. I was able to get to know my city through completely different eyes and show what I appreciate here. The association also offers mega fun and varied activities for the whole community, where you can spend an interesting time with other women, and I can only encourage every interested woman to take advantage of this meaningful opportunity and support other women!",

Under the motto ‘Behind every strong woman are strong women’, we want to contribute to empowerment and thus to a society that embraces its diversity and in which everyone has an equal say. The volunteer Tandem projects in Stuttgart, Bietigheim-Bissingen and Tübingen are therefore characterised not only by language and everyday support, but above all by events and activities of all kinds - because encounters are the key to inspiring, helpful, open and horizon-broadening interaction with one another.",
    "homeVereinInfoTwoBody": "According to a recent study by the OECD, female refugees are less well integrated into German society. The reason for this is the low level of participation in integration programmes and little contact with locals. Only 12% of refugee women in Germany have daily contact with locals. Female Fellows aims to counteract this phenomenon through the tandem project and take a big first step towards successful interaction. The tandem project also facilitates and promotes cultural exchange - these women have the potential, the capacity and the ability to act! It's about utilising the potential of women, empowering and encouraging them!",

We will of course endeavour to find a suitable Tandem partner for you as quickly as possible.",

Be it learning the German language, exchanging cultural ideas or getting to know your new surroundings better. State your wishes clearly so that your partner can respond to them. Another important question is: What can you show her? For example, are you particularly good at cooking? Think together about how you would like to organise the exchange - whether with regular walks, over dinner or in the library. It is important that it is clear to both of you from the start. Our Welcome KIT, which you will receive as soon as you have been matched, offers you initial assistance. You can find further suggestions here on the website.",

So talk about what you want from the tandem at the start of your partnership and set yourselves goals. Our recommendation is to spend about an hour together once a week. If this doesn't fit into your schedule, arrange other dates. That's not a problem as long as you talk about it and it's okay for both of you.",

    "tandemLocalsAnswer5": "If your partner no longer responds to your calls or messages, please let us know. We'll then try to find out what's going on and mediate between you. Sometimes it's due to a lack of internet in the accommodation, sometimes she doesn't have the courage to end the tandem. In any case, we want to talk to you about it and give you the best possible support in your tandem.",
    "tandemLocalsAnswer6": "Here too, it is important that you talk to both your partner and us about this. We will be happy to make sure that your partner finds a new tandem partner. Perhaps you have a friend who would like to take over the tandem?",

    "tandemLocalsAnswer9": "The 2019 crowdfunding campaign, for example, made it possible to finance a 25% staff position for tandem matchers as well as the project costs in Stuttgart from July 2019 to July 2020. You can find more information about cooperation partners and donations and how they are used here. donations to date have also made a significant contribution to the fact that we have been able to bring together a total of 122 tandems (which corresponds to 244 women in total) and that great events can be organised and held again and again.",
    "tandemLocalsAnswer10": "In the long term, we are aiming to finance an integration management centre in Stuttgart as well as permanent staff positions in Stuttgart, Bietigheim-Bissingen and Tübingen. We are also working on scaling up the Tandem project in Germany in general. We would also like to facilitate the integration of newcomers (women with a migration background) into the organisation team. Money is also needed for the DRC project (film project about Afghan women). Other projects such as workshops on Self-Reliance or Starting a career in Germany are also being planned.",

They both went for a walk to get to know each other better.  \nWhen I ask the two women how much has changed since they last met, they tell me that a lot has happened. They both wondered whether they would fit together despite their different cultures.  But as they got to know each other better, these doubts quickly disappeared. \nYasna is originally from Afghanistan and lives in Germany with her brother and parents.

She came across Female Fellows on the internet. When I asked Franziska what she liked about Yasna, she told us that she admired Yasna for her strength and for what she had already achieved in her young life. Yasna smiled with emotion and then Yasna and Franziska gave us an insight into their meetings together and the problems they often encounter.\nYasna lived in shared accommodation with her parents for a long time and had no place to retreat to. Fortunately, things have changed now that she has her own flat, which she is very happy about. However, she had no internet there as she lived in the basement and had no reception. She really wishes she had the internet, because it would make it easier for her to communicate with her friends and relatives from Afghanistan and, of course, with her parents.",

Both would like more support. \nI won't soon forget the atmosphere that this intimate conversation created. You can tell that Yasna and Franziska have grown very fond of each other and that they are both very happy to have met.\n Both women really enjoy meeting each other.

Add 175 ml water, 2-3 tsp salt and 1 tsp oil and knead until the dough becomes soft. Knead the dough for another 2 minutes and then cover with a cloth and leave to rest for approx. 1 hour.\n2 | For the filling, peel and quarter the potatoes and cook in salted water for approx. 15 minutes until soft.\n3 | Drain the potatoes, add 4 tsp of oil and mash. Clean, wash and finely chop the spring onions and coriander. Mix both with the potatoes and season with salt and pepper.\n4 | For the dip, place the yoghurt in a bowl. Peel and chop the garlic and add. Season with dill, coriander, salt and pepper.\n5 | Divide the dough into 6 pieces and roll out each piece into a round (approx. 20 cm in diameter). Spread the filling on one half of the dough, leaving a 1 cm border. Fold over the free side of the dough and press the edges down firmly. Fry the bolani in a pan with hot oil for 2-3 minutes on each side. Place on a piece of kitchen paper and leave to drain. Serve with yoghurt.\nGood appetite!",
    "tandemActivitySevenBody2": "Arabic cuisine: ”Auzi’ online cooking event with Baraa and Thaera\n In February 2021, we had a cosy online cooking event. Baraa and her mum Thaera taught us how to cook the Arabic dish ‘Auzi’. Here is the recipe (the respective quantities depend on the number of people eating):\n 1 | Boil chicken in salted water, after boiling bake in the oven at 250 degrees until golden brown (the water in which the chicken was cooked can later be used for the rice) - as a vegetarian variant, the chicken can be replaced by tofu (e.g. smoked tofu with almonds). smoked tofu with almonds), halloumi, falafel or similar \n2| Wash the basmati rice, peel the carrots and cook in boiling water until soft; if required: cook the peas \n3| Bring the (chicken) water to the boil (approx. double the amount of rice), add a little salt, pepper, vegetable stock and a little oil or butter (approx. 2 tbsp); add the washed rice. Once the rice has come to the boil, cover and leave to soak over a medium heat\n4| Heat a little oil or butter in a pan, cut the soft carrots into small cubes and add to the pan with the peas. Season to taste with salt, mint, pepper and any spices \n5| Pour oil into another pan and heat well, fry the peanuts until brown, add the almonds a little later and stir well (be careful, they can burn quickly!).    When the nuts have browned, add approx. 2 tbsp of sweetcorn\n6| Place the finished rice in a casserole dish, top with carrots and peas, then almond/peanut/corn mixture and chicken or meat substitute. Serve with yoghurt, add a little cinnamon to taste.\nGood appetite!",

At all our meetings, we start dancing as soon as our jukebox starts playing. Whether it's traditional dances from different cultures, modern dances or breakdancing, it doesn't matter. For us, it's all about having fun and exchanging ideas!\n2 | Afghan dance in the theatre\nIn October 2018, there was a great event on the topic of ‘different cultures’ at the Stuttgart Adult Education Centre. There were stands from different countries and cultures and, of course, lots of good food. The highlight of the day was a dance performance of various traditional dances, ranging from flamenco to traditional Afghan dance.\n3 | Afghan New Year\nOn the Afghan New Year, our Female Fellows were thrown in at the deep end. Without any introduction to traditional Afghan dance, each of them had to dance directly in the centre and the rest of the group formed a circle in which they all squatted. Then it was the next person's turn. We had a lot of fun together...",
