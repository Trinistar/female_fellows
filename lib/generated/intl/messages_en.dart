      "According to a recent OECD study, female refugees are less well integrated into German society. The reason for this is the low level of participation in integration programmes and little contact with locals. Only 12% of refugee women have daily contact with Germans. Female Fellows aims to counteract this and take a big (first) step towards successful coexistence. It is about utilising the potential of women, empowering and encouraging them. This form of support contributes to an open and reflective society that embraces its diversity and discovers the potential for further development and co-creation. As a tandem partner, you could make an important contribution to these goals. In addition, you will broaden your personal horizons and perhaps not only get to know your own city better through joint activities, but also exciting other cultures and, above all, many interesting people.",
